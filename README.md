# How to create Python Django app (blog site)

### This is a demonstration of creating a database driven website. It has been created after following the Django Girls Tutorial available at https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/. The tutorial covers installing Python, Django and some recommended code editors through to developing a Django app, deploying it to Cloud (www.pythonanywhere.com) and version control of the development process using Git (http://www.github.com).

### The developed blog website is live at http://floodyworm.pythonanywhere.com/

This project covers the following in sufficient detail so as to be comfortable with developing a new Django app:
1.  Python programming language basics
2.  Django Object Relational Mapping (ORM)
3.  Use of MySQL (other databases can be: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite 3, Oracle and NoSQL databases such as MongoDb and GoogleAppEngine Datastore. This project uses MySQL because with a free account, use of only MySQL database is permitted by www.pythonanywhere.com)
4.  HTML and Django Template extending
5.  Applying CSS 
6.  Implementing Bootstrap library
7.  Creating Django Forms
8.  Considerations to security (also see: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/howto/deployment/checklist/) before deploying to Cloud ( using www.pythonanywhere.com but others, such as, AWS can be used)
9.  Administration of the blog posts / website 
10. Version controlling of the project development using GitHub

My experience of developing this project will be published shortly.
