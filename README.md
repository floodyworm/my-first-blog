# How to create Python Django app (blog site)

### This is a demonstration of creating a database driven website. It has been created after following the Django Girls Tutorial available at https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/. The tutorial covers installing Python, Django and some recommended code editors through to developing a Django app, deploying it to Cloud (www.pythonanywhere.com) and version control of the development process using Git (http://www.github.com).


This project covers the following in sufficient detail so as to be comfortable with developing a new Django app:
1.  Python programming language basics
2.  Django Object Relational Mapping (ORM)
3.  Use of MySQL (Other databases can be: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite 3, Oracle and NoSQL databses such as 
4.  MongoDb and GoogleAppEngine Datastore. This project uses MySQL because www.pythonanywhere.com allows a free account only to use MySQL database.)
5.  HTML and Django Template extending
6.  Applying CSS 
7.  Implementing Bootstrap library
8.  Creating Django Forms
9.  Considerations to security (also see: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/howto/deployment/checklist/) before deploying to Cloud ( using www.pythonanywhere.com but others, such as, AWS can be used)
10. Version controlling of the project development using GitHub
